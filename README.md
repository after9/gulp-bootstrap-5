# gulp-bootstrap-5

Setup

To manually set up the template, first download it with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-zurb-template projectname
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
yarn
```

Finally, run `yarn start` to run Gulp. Your finished site will be created in a folder called `dist`, viewable at this URL:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

To create compressed, production-ready assets, run `yarn run build`.
